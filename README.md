EOS hub is an API marketplace with staking for EOS developers.

EOS Hub allows dApp developers to enter a new era of decentralized collaborative programming. The same staking model of incentive alignment between dApps and BPs can now be applied to the software layer. 

The SaaS market is estimated to reach $200B while the API economy as a whole is estimated reaching $2.2T in the coming two years. 
EOS hub multiplies efficiency and value by providing developers the opportunity to work **together** instead of against each other. With EOS hub developers can now keep a stake in the game instead of having their work enrich shareholders while the rest of the IT economy struggles with the same old competitive model based on spending.
